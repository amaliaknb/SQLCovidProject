Welcome to My First Project in SQL!

In this project, I would show you how I clean the world data about COVID-19 all around the world using SQL and retract some valuable information. The tools that I used in this project would include but not limited to:
1. Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 
2. SQL Server
3. Tableau

All the data I used in this project I retrieved it from https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus.

I finished this Project based on the tutorials from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8H48Pj32z4GZgGWyylqv85f
